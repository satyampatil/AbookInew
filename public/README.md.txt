📖 About The Project

Abooki is an experimental web platform that serves as a dynamic, AI-powered library. It allows users to generate unique 10-page mini-books instantly using Google's Gemini AI.

But it's more than just a generator—it's a community. Users can read stories generated by others, publish their own works to the "New Releases" shelf, rate stories, and earn badges for their reading habits. The platform features a unique "Active Readers" presence system where users appear as customizable ghosts floating in the central library.

✨ Key Features

🤖 AI Book Generation: Create coherent 10-page stories with custom titles, genres, and cover art generated on the fly.

📚 Dual Library System: Keep books in your private "My List" or Publish them to the global community.

🎧 Immersive Reader: Distraction-free reading mode with Text-to-Speech (Audiobook) functionality and word/paragraph highlighting.

💾 PDF Export: Download any generated book as a formatted PDF for offline reading.

👻 Social Presence: See other users (and bots) as floating ghosts in the Central Library in real-time.

🏆 Gamification: Earn badges for reading streaks, publishing books, and total books read.

🎨 Customization: Customize your ghost avatar (color, mood, accessories) and reading preferences (fonts, themes).
